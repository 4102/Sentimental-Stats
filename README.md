# Sentimental-Stats
This is the Scala team's term project for ITCS 4102/5102. The Sentimental Stats project will collect and analyze subjective impressions of a sports teams performance from news outlets and social media, and attempt to generate useful predictions of a team's future performance as evaluated through both those sentimental stats and publicly available 'objective' stats, such as margin-of-victory.
